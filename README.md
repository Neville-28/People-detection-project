# Warning-Avoiding-System

The initial thought of why naming the project for this name is because:

When I was young. I am not a boy who is free from worry. I like to reading comic books when I doing my homework.
However, sometime my parents will come to my room check what I am doing. Sometimes I will pay attention to when they are coming. However, sometime I am too fascinated to notice that they have came. 

After that, they blamed me.

So, I want to have this product to help the boys like me not to be blamed by their parents. (Kidding) 

Reading comic books after finishing the homework.
